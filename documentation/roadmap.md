# Roadmap

### Overview

This is a general outlook for the roadmap of the development of the SDK GUI. The initial development of the SKD GUI will consist of rudimentary features that include, but are not exclusive to;

- Create project
- Select work directory
- Delete project
- Fetch Algorand SDK git repository
- Update Algorand SDK local by fetching from upstream
- Can run TestNet
- UI settings (TBC)
